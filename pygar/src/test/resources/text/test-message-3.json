What Pliny says a- bout this animal in his natural history is not worth repeating; he had no idea of the beauty of the Eastern race. From all this it is easy to draw the conclusion, that in the south the cross with the oriental breed has done more for Eu- ropean horses than in the north. \\Ve recall the tbllowine' events as so many antecedent epochs relating to the crossing of the indigenous breeds with the Asiatic. The migration of the Goths, iwho over\u2014run Europe in dif- ferent directions as far as Spain. As a consequence of this immense accession to the population, horses, even from the north ofAsia, where they are the same in kind as the Sey- thian, were spread over Europe: this, however, would im\u2014 prove the blood only, not the form; for such a cross availed nothing in countries with marshy pasturages; and in such as are dry it was only productive of cleanness of make. This epoch also forms the date of the introduction of the common sort of horses from the south of Poland into Hungary and Transylvania; in which latter country they throve best in consequence of the salnbrity of the pasture. The invasion of the Moors in 710 introduced the oriental blood into Spain; where a continuance during; eight centuries atl'orded it every opportunity for propagation; and besides, the elevated and dry pasturages ot'Andalusia were well suited to preserve the purity and form of such a race: the magnificence of the Saracen prince, the galanti'y of the courts of Grenada and Cordovia, the carousals ot' the grandees, became additional motives for the transportation of the most admired horses into Spain. In the tenth century we behold the grand \"vizier otteriniaT to the calif, among other valuable presents, fifteen Arabian horses. By the Moors were also introduced into Europe the first Arabian stallions. In 732, the Saracens, to the number of two hundred thousand, made incursions even to the walls of Poitiers. Charles Martel completely repulsed them: their general Abd-el Rahman was killed. Thus routed they unavoidably left behind them great numbers of their horses. So that this appears to be the epoch when the French breeds first derived any advantages from cross\u2014 ing. Under the dominion of Napoleon, France has imported upwards of two hundred Arabian stallions!"
