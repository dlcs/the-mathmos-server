Either Mr. Coleman is, or is not capable of teachingr phy- siology and the treatment of disease. About this, although he mayunot have kept l'ull pace with the advance of Veterinary science, and althou'rh he may push some of his l'uVourite theories to an absurd and [ludicrous extent, there can be no question, If those about him think otherwise, let the proper representation be made in the proper quarter. If there be those who do not believe in, or cannot uphold Mr. Coleman's grand and favourite theories, let them take the course which, in every other situation, good sense and honourable feeling would indicate. _ The constitution of the College might indeed be changed most materially for the better. There might be three or more. professors, and each might haVe his so arute department (Jfflntt- tomy or physiology, or the treatment o diseiise, and in different animals; and each might expound his ownvievvs and theories, without interfering with the authority, or encroaching on the pro- vinCe of the other. This would be a most material improve- ment; but when there is actually but one professor—one pre- mier and his assistants,—a ministry must be unanimous, or it cannot be effectual.

We do not admire this avowed oppo- sition—this declared warfare—between the professor and his as- sistams. It is notin good taste. It does no credit to anybody We duly ap reciate the independent spirit which Mr. Vines has assumed in this publication ; we acknowledge his ri ht to form his own opinions, and to bring them before the public, int not to the. compromise of other duties. On the whole, we cordiall recommend this work to the con- sideration of our readers. here is much good stuff in it, per— haps encumbered and obscured by an arrangement far too complicated, and sometimes unintelligible; and by a constant reference to authorities never good for much, and long obsolete, and compared with which one sentence of Mr. Vines's would _.._._.,_—~.-.—.—— A"
